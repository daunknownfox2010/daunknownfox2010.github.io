                        <b>Half-Life 2 Campaign</b> is a gamemode for Garry's Mod that was created by <i>AMT</i> years ago.
                        Garry's Mod 13 broke the gamemode, so I decided to pick it up and maintain it.
                        There's been huge amounts of fixes and additions made by me and has been tested from start to end.
                        The gamemode is in a stable state that's always improving. The gamemode is open on GitHub for anyone to fork, edit and so on.

                        <b>open Virus</b> is a gamemode for Garry's Mod that was created by me which is, however, inspired on TimeSplitters + PixelTail's Virus.
                        The idea is simple, you have 90 seconds to survive an infection outbreak.
                        Survivors are given random weapons to defend themselves with, while the infected must touch a survivor to spread the infection.
                        The gamemode code is hosted on GitHub for anyone to fork, edit and so on.

                        <b>Lazer Zone</b> is a gamemode for Garry's Mod that was created by me which is inspired from a real Lazer Tag arena in Perth, WA.
                        There are three teams: Red, Blue and Yellow. Teams must score the most amount of points to win the game.
                        Points are given to players when they kill another player or they destroy another team's base.
                        The gamemode code is hosted on GitHub for anyone to fork, edit and so on.

                        The map is made for Prop Hunt, a popular gamemode in the Garry's Mod community.
                        This is my first ever properly published map, though, it has its flaws. I'm not good at mapping honestly.

                        The gamemode doesn't make use of Fretta either.
