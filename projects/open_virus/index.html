            <h1>What is it?</h1>
            <p>This gamemode is an open-source recreation of the popular GMod Tower and Tower Unite gamemode called Virus. The concept is the same, however, there are differences:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This gamemode does NOT use weapons or content from GMod Tower or Tower Unite.</li>
                <li>Servers can change the gameplay of open Virus.</li>
                <li>open Virus is NOT created by the PixelTail developers. We recommend buying Tower Unite if you want to support them.</li>
                <li>open Virus uses Counter-Strike: Source content.</li>
                <li>open Virus is hosted on Github. The community is allowed to make improvements if needed.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Things to know...</h1>
            <h2>General</h2>
            <p style="margin-top: 0">
                The general idea of the gamemode is simple.
                There are 10 rounds per game, each round lasts about 90 seconds.
                The game consists of two "teams", the Survivors and the Infected.
                Due to how Virus is designed, it's generally considered fast-paced.
            </p>
            <h2>Survivors</h2>
            <p style="margin-top: 0">
                Survivors are given 90 seconds to survive, that's all there is to it.
                They spawn with a random selection of weapons each round, except for the Adrenaline and SLAM, so make use of what you got.
            </p>
            <h2>Infected</h2>
            <p style="margin-top: 0">
                The infected have 90 seconds to infect ALL of the survivors, it's not so complicated.
                They have no weapons, they must "run" into the survivors to infect them when they emit a green flame.
                While infected, you are slightly faster than the survivors, so make use of your speed.
                If a lone infected player dies too much, they will enter "enraged mode", so be careful!
            </p>
            <h2>Radar</h2>
            <p style="margin-top: 0">
                Your radar is the single most useful thing in Virus.
                The radar reveals the locations of ALL players in the game, including the other team.
                Using your radar is crucial for both teams, so use it well.
            </p>
            <h2>Adrenaline</h2>
            <p style="margin-top: 0">
                The Adrenaline is available to survivors only.
                You can select the Adrenaline like a normal weapon, or press the button bound to the context menu to quick-switch to it.
                Once used, the survivor has a 15 second speed boost.
            </p>
            <h2>SLAM</h2>
            <p style="margin-top: 0">
                The SLAM is a nice little explosive for survivors.
                Just throw it on the ground and watch it explode as the infected get close!
            </p>
            <h2>"Enraged Mode"</h2>
            <p style="margin-top: 0">
                If you're an infected player, if you die a few times without infecting anyone at the start of the game, you will become enraged.
                Enraged infected have a lot more health and are very fast, as a survivor you should be careful of them!
