            <h1>About</h1>
            <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 4px">Half-Life 2 Campaign is a gamemode for Garry's Mod. The gamemode allows you to play Half-Life 2 in Garry's Mod without being given all the weapons and Sandbox equipment. Oh... and you can play with friends too!</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0">Originally created by <b>AMT</b>, the premise is to create a vanilla Half-Life 2 experience within Garry's Mod without the need of a mod like Synergy. Garry's Mod is customisable too, allowing for optional content such as custom player models and more.</p>
            <h1>FAQs</h1>
            <h2>Does this actually play Half-Life 2?</h2>
            <p style="margin-top: 0">Short answer: Yes! This gamemode plays through Half-Life 2 in both singleplayer and multiplayer.</p>
            <h2>Does this support the Episodes?</h2>
            <p style="margin-top: 0">Short answer: No. There is no proper support for the Episodes in Garry's Mod due to internal functions within Garry's Mod not actually supporting the full Episodic functions.</p>
            <h2>Does this include Half-Life 2 maps</h2>
            <p style="margin-top: 0">HECK NO! That is very illegal and I could get in trouble for doing that. Please buy Half-Life 2 on Steam, it's fairly cheap these days.</p>
            <h2>Why are some scenes broken/skipped?</h2>
            <p style="margin-top: 0">These scene errors are usually caused by Garry's Mod either not implementing necessary functions or the fact it's playing in multiplayer.</p>
            <h2>Can this play custom co-op maps?</h2>
            <p style="margin-top: 0">Oh yes it can! There's a GitHub repository hosting some map lua files for a few custom co-op maps.</p>
            <h2>But... We already have Synergy/Obsidian Conflict!</h2>
            <p style="margin-top: 0">Yes, I know. This is just an alternative, cause more options are better right?</p>
            <h2>You beta test Obsidian Conflict, why bother?</h2>
            <p style="margin-top: 0">Read above. Once Obsidian Conflict does release on Steam though, I will put development of this gamemode behind.</p>
            <h2>I'd like to donate for your efforts</h2>
            <p style="margin-top: 0">I feel I don't need donations as the original work is from AMT. Feel free to contact me about it though.</p>
            <h2>I'd like to report a bug!</h2>
            <p style="margin-top: 0">Please report bugs to GitHub.</p>
