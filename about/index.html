            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <img src="../assets/images/icon.png" alt="Jai the Fox" style="margin-top: 20px">
            <h2 style="margin-top: 20px">Generally...</h2>
            <p>My name is <b>Jaidan Escott</b>, I'm a 19 year old (furry) guy that lives around Perth, Western Australia.</p>
            <p>I'm known for doing things in relation to computers and programming. I can be referred to as "that tech fox", however, call me whatever you like.</p>
            <p>If you just stumbled upon this website by any chance, hi! It's good to see stalkers around here... Just kidding, I like the fact you're spending your time to read this.</p>
            </br>
            <p>I recently wrote this "About Me" section to expand on the home page, if you're interested at all. It's probably lacking some information you might be after too, who knows.</p>
            <h2 style="margin-top: 40px">What do I do?</h2>
            <p>Simple really, I work with computers both hardware and software. I love playing video games especially, though I've mostly ever played Sandbox style games.</p>
            <p>I've taken time to learn HTML & CSS, C#, Java, PHP and Lua. Some are learned through Perth's South Metropolitan TAFE, while others are from my own time.</p>
            <p>I do wish to work on learning more such as C/C++ and Python. These will probably come by later in the future.</p>
            <h2 style="margin-top: 40px">Yes, I'm a furry.</h2>
            <p>Oh so controversial, I know.</p>
            <p>My main fursona is a fox, which has an odd colour scheme which resembles the likes of milk & white chocolate. Perhaps this is why I've been nicknamed the "Chocolate Fox"?</p>
            <p>You can find my fursona information in the fursona page if you really want to see him.</p>
            </br>
            <p>Anyway, if you wish to hate me for being a furry that's your problem and you don't need to escalate anything further.</p>
            <h2 style="margin-top: 40px">I'm an average social.</h2>
            <p>Now, you're probably thinking "what the heck is an average social?" and well, I'm thinking the same thing honestly...</p>
            <p>Really I'm not too boring nor too interesting, I'm a rather plain person. That's what I'm trying to get at here.</p>
            <h2 style="margin-top: 40px">My online contacts...</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 20px">...are all available on the top-right corner. Message me on Steam, Discord and/or Telegram!
